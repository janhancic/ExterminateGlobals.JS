Then call `ExterminateGlobals.collect();` after all JavaScript has finished executing (you can of course do that manually, from the console). This will then generate a nice report in your browser's console:\r\n\r\n![ExterminateGlobals.JS-in-action](https://raw.github.com/janhancic/ExterminateGlobals.JS/master/misc/readme_screenshot.png \"ExterminateGlobals.JS in action\")\r\n\r\nAfter that start hunting down your unwanted globals and exterminate them.\r\n\r\n### What if I have known globals?\r\nNot to worry, the `ExterminateGlobals.startCollecting()`, as its first argument, accepts an array of names (strings) of known globals which will be ignored when generating the report.\r\n\r\n### Can I use this to monitor any other object?\r\nWhy of course, just pass the object you want to monitor as the second argument to `ExterminateGlobals.startCollecting()`.\r\n\r\n## Advanced usage\r\nBesides `startCollecting()` and `collect()` the `ExterminateGlobals` also contains a constructor function `GlobalsCollector` (which the convenience functions startCollecting&collect use internally). This means you can monitor multiple objects at the same time or just obtain the list of unwanted globals as an array instead of printing everything out to the console.\r\n\r\nUsage example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar globalsCollector = new ExterminateGlobals.GlobalsCollector( ['$', 'jQuery'], myObject);\r\nglobalsCollector.startCollecting();\r\n// your code here\r\nvar unwantedGlobals = globalsCollector.collect();\r\nglobalsCollector.print(); // pass ExterminateGlobals.PRINT_COMPACT for more compact report\r\n```\r\n## Breaking when code writes a unwanted global\r\nIf you use the `ExterminateGlobals.GlobalsCollector` directly you get one extra feature. If you call `saveUnwantedGlobals(true)` on your object before you start collecting the globals, it will save the list of found globals to `localStorage`. Then if you refresh the page and start collecting again, `GlobalsCollector` will insert break points which will get hit whenever your code is writing to a global variable. This makes finding globals even easier, as you are shown directly where in your code you've made a mistake.\r\n\r\nLook at the `ExterminateGlobals.js` file for full API documentation.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) is used for testing. To run the tests just load the `spec/SpecRunner.html` file in your browser.\r\n\r\n## Test report\r\nTests pass in the following browsers:\r\n- Google Chrome v31.0.1636.0 dev, OS X\r\n- Apple Safari v6.0.5, OS X\r\n- Mozilla Firefox v24.0, OS X\r\n\r\n## License\r\nLicensed under MIT.
