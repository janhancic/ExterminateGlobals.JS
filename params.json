Then call `ExterminateGlobals.stop();` after all JavaScript has finished executing (you can of course do that manually, from the console). This will then generate a nice report in your browser's console:\r\n\r\n![ExterminateGlobals.JS-in-action](https://raw.github.com/janhancic/ExterminateGlobals.JS/master/misc/readme_screenshot.png \"ExterminateGlobals.JS in action\")\r\n\r\nAfter that start hunting down your unwanted globals and exterminate them.\r\n\r\n### What if I have known globals?\r\nNot to worry, the `ExterminateGlobals.start()`, as its first argument, accepts an array of names (strings) of known globals which will be ignored when generating the report.\r\n\r\n### Can I use this to monitor any other object?\r\nWhy of course, just pass the object you want to monitor as the second argument to `ExterminateGlobals.start()`.\r\n\r\n## Advanced usage\r\nBesides `start()` and `stop()` the `ExterminateGlobals` also contains a constructor function `GlobalsCollector` (which the convenience functions start&stop use internally). This means you can monitor multiple objects at the same time or just obtain the list of unwanted globals as an array instead of printing everything out to the console.\r\n\r\nUsage example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar globalsCollector = new ExterminateGlobals.GlobalsCollector( ['$', 'jQuery'], myObject);\r\nglobalsCollector.startCollecting();\r\n// your code here\r\nvar unwantedGlobals = globalsCollector.collect();\r\nglobalsCollector.print();\r\n```\r\n\r\nLook at the `ExterminateGlobals.js` file for full API documentation.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) is used for testing. To run the tests just load the `SpecRunner.html` file in your browser.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nLicensed under MIT.
